This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the MongoDB driver in a Java application. The MongoDB driver is used to interact with the MongoDB database, 
allowing you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data.

To get started, follow these steps:
Step 1: Download the jar file from ![https://jar-download.com/?search_box=mongo-java-driver]. I am using jar file Version 3.12.14.
Step 2: Extract the jar file and add it to the build path of your project.
Step 3: Make sure you enter the right address and port number for the mongodb server while creating mongodb client

You are good to go
